# Shadow mode toggle
# Set MODE=SHADOW to enable shadow inference.
#
# In shadow mode, the candidate model runs in parallel on the same
# incoming request payloads, but its predictions are only logged
# for offline analysis and do NOT affect the response returned
# to the client.
#
# This allows safe validation of model changes such as recall
# improvements using real request data without impacting
# production decisions.
#
# Any value other than "SHADOW", for example "PROD" or empty,
# disables shadow mode and uses the primary decision path.
MODE=PROD


# Fraud decision threshold
# Probability above which a transaction is classified as fraud
# in the primary decision path.
FRAUD_THRESHOLD=0.5


# Web server concurrency
# Number of Gunicorn worker processes handling requests.
# Tune this per environment based on CPU and load.
